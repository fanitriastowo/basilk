## History
It was a [very hot August night](https://www.meteo.it/notizie/meteo-caldo-in-aumento-la-tendenza-verso-ferragosto-c95aa7dc), and I was organizing my activities when at a certain point I felt the need for a software that could help me with this, something simple and portable. **basilk** is created as a summer project to learn Rust and to be able to use the software anywhere. 

The name [_/ˈbæzəlkeɪ/_](https://gabalpha.github.io/read-audio/?p=https://github.com/GabAlpha/basilk/raw/master/assets/basil-k.wav) comes from the basil plant, which is easy to grow and maintain, and "k" stands for kanban.

The name [_/ˈbæzsɪlk/_](https://gabalpha.github.io/read-audio/?p=https://github.com/GabAlpha/basilk/raw/master/assets/bas-silk.wav) comes from the union of basil and silk as a symbol of elaborateness due to its production process.

## About
**basilk** is structured to create projects and within each project to create tasks with a specific status (Up Next/On Going/Done).

The data structure is saved in `.json` format and is available in the directory:
```
Linux
~/.config/basilk

macOS
~/Library/Application Support/basilk

Windows
<USER>\AppData\Roaming\basilk
```
The choice to use the JSON format is to make easier to export

This is a fork of the original [basilk](https://github.com/GabAlpha/basilk) project, carrying the feature work from [LiuYinCarl/basilk](https://github.com/LiuYinCarl/basilk) ([upstream PR #27](https://github.com/GabAlpha/basilk/pull/27)). For the original version, please refer to the upstream repository.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fanitriastowo/basilk && cd basilk
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage
Run

The timer keeps running while you navigate (even back to the project list); it stops when you press `Enter` in the timer view or when you quit.

- **Stopwatch** (`s`, task list): bound to the selected task; the elapsed time accumulates into the task's **Time Spent**, shown in the details view next to the task's **Estimate** (how long you expect the task to take, editable per task with `g`; the details view shows what percentage of the estimate has been spent).
- **Pomodoro** (`c`, both views): a global countdown for focus sessions; at zero it rings the terminal bell and stays on screen (showing `time's up!`) until you press any key. It is not tied to any task, so nothing is accumulated.

Tasks are displayed as `[Status] Title` with optional `[Priority]` prefix and, for tasks with an estimate set, a `[x%]` suffix showing how much of the estimate has been spent (red once it reaches 100%).
- Statuses: **UpNext** (magenta), **OnGoing** (yellow), **Done** (green, ~~crossed out~~)
- Priorities: `!` (highest), `!!` (high), `!!!` (low)

Completed tasks are **hidden by default** in the task list view. Press `t` to toggle their visibility.

Press `b` in the task list view to switch to a kanban **board view**: three vertical lanes (**Up Next** / **On Going** / **Done**), each titled with its task count, the focused lane highlighted in its status color. Use `←`/`→` to move between lanes and `↑`/`↓` to select a task within a lane; every other shortcut (`v` details, `Enter` status, `p` priority, timers, …) works the same, and changing a task's status moves it to the matching lane. The board always shows the Done lane, regardless of the `t` setting (which is a no-op while the board is active).

Press `m` in the project list view to open **notes**: global, project-independent memos. A note is a titled entry whose body is Markdown; opening one shows a full-page rendered preview (headings, bold/italic, code blocks, lists, quotes, links), and `e` switches to a full-page multi-line editor for the Markdown source (`Esc` saves and returns to the preview).
